        <h3>
            <p>Cleaning is important for the health and safety. If the hallways and rooms within a college is cluttered
                with rubbish, cables, boxes and other obstacles, it increases the likelihood of accidents and mishaps.
                If a serious injury occurs as a result of a disorganised work environment, it can potentially lead to
                more severe problems, including lawsuits and a loss of productivity and faith in the college.</p>

            <p> Maintaining a clean college environment sets a good example to students. It encourages learners to take
                pride in their university or college, which makes them less likely to drop litter and as such they will
                potentially make a bigger effort to maintain their environment.</p>

                <p>Planting trees can be an effective way to restore landscapes, but not always—far from it. For
                    example,
                    afforestation has been accepted as an important strategy for preventing soil erosion on the Loess
                    Plateau in north-central China, but scientists are increasingly questioning the long-term
                    sustainability
                    of afforestation in such an arid environment. Moreover, tree planting is biologically risky. The
                    total
                    survival rate of trees in the Loess Plateau has been low in some areas, and only 25% of the 400,000
                    Chinese pine trees planted in northern Shaanxi as part of China’s “Grain for Green” policy survived.
                    Natural regeneration, sometimes with the assistance of fire suppression and reduced grazing, can be
                    a
                    better approach than tree planting</p>

                <p>Street theatre is a form of theatrical performance and presentation in outdoor public spaces without

                    recreational reserves, college or university campus and street corners. They are especially seen in
                    outdoor spaces where there are large numbers of people. The actors who perform street theatre range
                    from buskers to organised theatre companies or groups that want to experiment with performance
                    spaces, or to promote their mainstream work. It was a source of providing information to people when
                    there were no sources of providing information like television, radio etc. Nowadays, street play is
                    used to convey a message to the crowd watching it.[1] Street play is considered to be the rawest
                    form of acting, because one does not have a microphone or loud speakers.</p>
